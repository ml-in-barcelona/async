 * Schema Reporting_report_type.t : The Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the \''Activity summary\'' or \''Itemized payouts\'' reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.  Note that reports can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and thus related requests must be made with a [live-mode API key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#test-live-modes).
