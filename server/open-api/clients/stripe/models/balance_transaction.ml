 * Schema Balance_transaction.t : Balance transactions represent funds moving through your Stripe account. They're created for every type of transaction that comes into or flows out of your Stripe account balance.

  (* The exchange rate used, if applicable, for this transaction. Specifically, if money was converted from currency A to currency B, then the `amount` in currency A, times `exchange_rate`, would be the `amount` in currency B. For example, suppose you charged a customer 10.00 EUR. Then the PaymentIntent's `amount` would be `1000` and `currency` would be `eur`. Suppose this was converted into 12.34 USD in your Stripe account. Then the BalanceTransaction's `amount` would be `1234`, `currency` would be `usd`, and `exchange_rate` would be `1.234`. *)
