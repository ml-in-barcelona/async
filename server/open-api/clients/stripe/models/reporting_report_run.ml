 * Schema Reporting_report_run.t : The Report Run object represents an instance of a report type generated with specific run parameters. Once the object is created, Stripe begins processing the report. When the report has finished running, it will give you a reference to a file where you can retrieve your results. For an overview, see [API Access to Reports](https://stripe.com/docs/reporting/statements/api).  Note that reports can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and thus related requests must be made with a [live-mode API key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys#test-live-modes).
