  (* The type of entity that holds the account. This can be either `individual` or `company`. *)

  (* Name of the bank associated with the routing number (e.g., `WELLS FARGO`). *)
  bank_name : string option; [@default None]
  (* Two-letter ISO code representing the country of the card. You could use this attribute to get a sense of the international breakdown of cards you've collected. *)
  country : string option;
  (* Three-letter [ISO code for currency](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts). Only applicable on accounts (not customers or recipients). The card can be used as a transfer destination for funds in this currency. *)

  (* The customer that this card belongs to. This attribute will not be in the card object if the card belongs to an account or recipient instead. *)
  customer : Any_ofstringcustomerdeleted_customer.t option; [@default None]

  default_for_currency : bool option; [@default None]
  (* Uniquely identifies this particular card number. You can use this attribute to check whether two customers who’ve signed up with you are using the same card number, for example. For payment methods that tokenize card information (Apple Pay, Google Pay), the tokenized number might be provided instead of the underlying card number. *)
  fingerprint : string option; [@default None]
  (* Unique identifier for the object. *)
  id : string;
  (* The last four digits of the card. *)

  (* Set of [key-value pairs](https://stripe.com/docs/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. *)

  _object : Enums.card_object; [@default `Card]
  (* The routing transit number for the bank account. *)
  routing_number : string option; [@default None]
  (* For bank accounts, possible values are `new`, `validated`, `verified`, `verification_failed`, or `errored`. A bank account that hasn't had any activity or validation performed is `new`. If Stripe can determine that the bank account exists, its status will be `validated`. Note that there often isn’t enough information to know (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank account status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be `verification_failed`. If a transfer sent to this bank account fails, we'll set the status to `errored` and will not continue to send transfers until the bank details are updated.  For external accounts, possible values are `new` and `errored`. Validations aren't run against external accounts because they're only used for payouts. This means the other statuses don't apply. If a transfer fails, the status is set to `errored` and transfers are stopped until account details are updated. *)

  brand : string;
  (* If a CVC was provided, results of the check: `pass`, `fail`, `unavailable`, or `unchecked`. A result of unchecked indicates that CVC was provided but hasn't been checked yet. Checks are typically performed when attaching a card to a Customer object, or when creating a charge. For more details, see [Check if a card is valid without a charge](https://support.stripe.com/questions/check-if-a-card-is-valid-without-a-charge). *)
