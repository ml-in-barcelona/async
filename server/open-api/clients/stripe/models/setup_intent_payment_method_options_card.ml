However, if you wish to request 3D Secure based on logic from your own fraud engine, provide this option. Permitted values include: `automatic` or `any`. If not provided, defaults to `automatic`. Read our guide on [manually requesting 3D Secure](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/3d-secure#manual-three-ds) for more information on how this configuration interacts with Radar and our SCA Engine. *)
