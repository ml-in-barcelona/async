 * Schema Checkout_session.t : A Checkout Session represents your customer's session as they pay for one-time purchases or subscriptions through [Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout). We recommend creating a new Session each time your customer attempts to pay.  Once payment is successful, the Checkout Session will contain a reference to the [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers), and either the successful [PaymentIntent](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents) or an active [Subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions).  You can create a Checkout Session on your server and pass its ID to the client to begin Checkout.  Related guide: [Checkout Server Quickstart](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/api).
